      <h1>Portfolio of coding projects by Dan Nollette</h1>
      <p>This page is a reference of my assorted coding projects. It's in chronological order ascending (i.e. oldest at the bottom). If you have any questions or would just like to get in contact feel free to email me <a href="mailto:nollette.dan@gmail.com">here</a>. </p>
      <p>At the time of this writing (August 4th, 2017), I am just finishing my first week of instruction at Epicodus. Topics covered this week include basic <strong>GIT, HTML, CSS,</strong> and the <strong>Bootstrap</strong> frontend framework.</p>

          <h2>Wikipedia Rebuild</h2>
          <h3>Project Creation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bootstrap styling</li>
            <li>custom style sheet</li>
            <li>inspecting and mimicking the wikipedia homepage</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For this project, my partner, <em>Kelsey Langlois</em>, and I were attempting to recreate the wikipedia homepage. The project proved more extensive than we had originally realized, but after concerted effort we were able to create a reasonalbe facsimile. the page can be found online <a href="https://dan-nollette.github.io/wikipedia-rebuild/">here</a>.</p>

          <h2>Animal Shelter page</h2>
          <h3>Project Creation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use of cascading in CSS</li>
            <li>This was our first use of a media query</li>
            <li>We had lots of fun making up animal facts for this one.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For this project, my partner, <em>Kristen Kuhla</em>, and I created a webpage for an animal shelter. The animals are strange, but the look of the page is quite neat. We had a good time working on this.</p>

          </ul>
          <p>For this project, my partner, <em>Erik Zakrzewski</em>, and I were assigned to create a webpage about a resort. We opted to make the resort Giant cat themed.This was some of our first experience with CSS and with linking between pages</p>

          <p>My name is Dan, and I've been many things. I was a professional gambler, a wallpaper hanger, and for several years, a pizza guy. Most recently I've worked in Web Support for a couple of years a <a href="https://www.Luxre.com">LuxuryRealEstate.com</a>, and now I'm a student at Epicodus.</p>
          <p>I decided to come to Epicodus becuase after a couple years of working a job that involved some coding and a lot of answering customer emails, I wanted to finally transition into fulltime Dev work.</p>
